plex server will allow you to host all of your digital media and to stream it.   

This document will include how to setup your plex server, digitize your media libraries, setup remote backup and organize them so that Plex can correctly recognize them.

# Plex Server Setup
plex can be hosted on Windows, Linux, docker, certain NAS devices.

Due to the lighter weight nature, and to support 4k HDR tone mapping I recommend using Linux.

## Digitization 
### Manual digitization
To manually copy your media you will need a computer and a corresponding ROM device (e.g. DVD for DVDs and CDs, Blueray for Blueray, DVD and CDs).
**Rip the disk**.  
You can use MakeMKV.  If the disk cannot be ripped due to being "protected" you can usually use ShrinkDVD to rip it to disk and then use MakeMKV to make your Plex files.
